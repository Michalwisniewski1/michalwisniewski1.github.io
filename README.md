# My-first-chat-app

Hello!


This is my first app created by using: ReactJS, Firebase, babel, HTML, Sass, Material-ui, webpack.
Chat app is connecting with Firebase base in realtime. It's possible to send/fetch data. I've used Google authorization to secure app from anonymus users. App was styled with Material-ui/Sass framework.

In the future I'd like to use Redux/Flux frameworks for more effective managing data in realtime. Next is planned to
add specially protected channels and possibility to send images and voice recordings.
